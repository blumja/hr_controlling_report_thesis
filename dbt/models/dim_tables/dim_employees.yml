  - name: dim_employees
    description: >-
      This table contains general data of the employees. Terminated employees' data is mostly empty.

      This model uses the following CTEs:

      - `union_employees`: Unions the two tables "factorial_terminated_employees" and "factorial_active_employees" into one table using the dbt_utils function.
      - `min_start_date`: Since the employee stream no longer supports the started_on column the value has to be taken form the contracts stream.
      - `join_start_date`: This CTE joins the union_employees and min_start_date ctes.

    columns:
      - name: factorial_id
        description: >-
            The factorial id of the employee
