  - name: factorial_terminated_employees
    description: |
      This table contains the base data of all the terminated employees. It
      is also used in the airbyte call to get all of the data from the other
      streams based on the id without actually obtaining directly personalized
      data like name and birthdate. The model is built using the following CTEs:

      - `source`: This CTE retrieves the data from the source.
      - `casted`: This CTE renames the columns and casts the datatypes if needed.

    columns:
      - name: id
        description: Unique identifier for each employee.
        tests:
          - unique
          - not_null
      - name: terminated_on
        description: Date when the employee was terminated.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: termination_reason
        description: Reason for termination of the employee.
      - name: termination_reason_type
        description: Type of termination reason.
      - name: termination_observations
        description: Observations related to termination.
