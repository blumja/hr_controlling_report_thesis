      Table containing the emails and troi names of the active employees with  an ID. Needed to map the names after an initial anonymization. The model  is built using the following CTEs:

      - `source`: This CTE retrieves the data from the source.
      - `renamed`: This CTE lists the needed columns.

    columns:
      - name: id
        description: >-
          Id for each employee.
      - name: troi_name
        description: >-
          Employee name. Same as shown in troi. For terminated employees the name will be of the following
          format "Ausgeschiedener Mitarbeiter <ID>". The id is the same as
          in the id column.
      - name: email

          Company email of the employee.

      - name: name
