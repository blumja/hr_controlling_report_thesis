      Base model to rename the columns of a table containing the employees troi time tracking and absence times. The data gets filtered to only include actual day-entries instead of the summary and empty rows inbetween. The model is built using the following CTEs:

      - `source`: This CTE retrieves the data from the source.
      - `renamed`: This CTE renames and casts the columns for better readability and type consistency.
      - `cleaned_day_entries`: This CTE filters out the summary and empty rows.

    columns:
      - name: monat
        description: Date of the data entry.
