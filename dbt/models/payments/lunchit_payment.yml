  - name: lunchit_payment
    description: >-
      Table containing the cleaned and mapped lunchit export data. Other than
      before it only shows the cumulative sum of the payments per month. It
      uses the following CTEs:

      - `add_payment`: calculates the benefit payments from the lunchit data. The CTE performs a safe addition operation for the columns 'lunchit_1_2' and 'lunchit_2_2' and filters out any NULL values.
      - `add_id`: Maps the factorial ids to the lunchit data by joining the factorial employee data on the emails.

    columns:
      - name: date
        description: >-
          Month of the reimbursement. While the original data shows the date as
          the first day of the next month from when the entry was submitted but
          after transformation it is the month the entry was submitted. To
          properly assign the data in the dashboard with the other payments.
