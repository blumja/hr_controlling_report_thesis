  - name: inflation_payment
    description: >-
      This model contains data about the paid inflation compensation.
      And it uses the following CTEs:

      - `pivot_inflation`: As the original data is part of a collection of custom tables the data has to be pivoted first. Since the dbt_utils pivot function only works with numeric values a custom macro is used.

    columns:
      - name: date
        description: >-
          Month of the payment.
      - name: factorial_id
        description: >-
          Id for each employee in factorial.
      - name: amount
        description: >-
          Amount to be paid by the employeer.
