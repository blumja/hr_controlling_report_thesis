  - name: cleaned_absences
    description: |
      This model processes the industrial working hours to extract absence data,
      clean the values, and calculate hours and mandays for different absence
      types. It uses the following CTEs:

      - `extract_absence`: This CTE extracts the absence data from the industrial_working_hours table and splits the hours and mandays for each absence type into seperate columns.
      - `fill_null`: This CTE replaces any empty hour and manday values with NULL to prepare for further processing.
      - `data_type`: This CTE casts and replaces the cleaned hour and manday values to floats for each absence type.

    columns:
      - name: date
        description: The date of the absence record.
