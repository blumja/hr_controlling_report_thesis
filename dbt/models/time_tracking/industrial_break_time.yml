    description: |
      This dbt model, named "industrial_break_time", contains a series of
      common table expressions (CTEs) that calculate the industrial break time
      for each "troi_name" on a given date.

      The CTEs included in this model are as follows:

      - `split_breaks`: Splits and extracts the "break_time_period" column into individual break times in case someone took more than one.
      - `single_break`: Trimming the values to obtain the break times.
      - `start_end`: Splits the extracted break times into start and end times, and trims the values for each.
      - `break_min`: Calculates the duration of each break in minutes using the start and end times.
      - `break_time`: Converts the break duration from minutes to the HH:MM format.
      - `break_industrial`: Calculates the total industrial break time in decimal hours for each "troi_name" on a given date.

    columns:
      - name: date
        description: Date of the data entry.
