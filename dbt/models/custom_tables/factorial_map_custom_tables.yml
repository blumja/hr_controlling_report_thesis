models:
  - name: factorial_map_custom_tables
    description: |
      After unpacking the columns and value pairs the table and column names need to be mapped.
      The model is built using the following CTEs:

      - `mapped_custom_tables`: factorial_unpack_custom_table_val and factorial_custom_tables are joined to map the table and column names.

    columns:
      - name: id
        description: Identifier for the table entry of an employee.
        tests:
          - not_null

        description: Identifier of the employee.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: table_id
        description: Identifier of the table.
        tests:
          - not_null
      - name: table_name
        description: Table name.
