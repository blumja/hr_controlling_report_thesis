      This fact table contains the employees working hours, break time and
      distribution of capacity utilisation. While showing the difference
      between plannend and actual worked hours (+ absences).

      This model uses the following CTEs:

      - `joined_tables`: This CTE joins the cleaned_absences and industrial_break_time tables to retrieve the necessary data for further processing.
      - `filter_col`: This CTE adds a new column "filter_col" which is the result of adding the industrial working hours, break amount, soll, wb, nwb, and abwesenheiten_hours.
      - `total_ist_col`: This CTE adds a new column "total_ist" which is the result of adding the industrial working hours and abwesenheiten_hours.
      - `legal_break_time`: Adds a column with the legal break time based on the German labor laws for required breaks.
      - `compliance_break_time`: Adds another column which shows if the employee complied to said laws.
