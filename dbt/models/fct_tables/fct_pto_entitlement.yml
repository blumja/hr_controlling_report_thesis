    description: >-
      Fact table containing the employees paid time off entitlement and already taken days.
      This model consists of the following CTEs:

      - `name_join`: Joins the name_mapping_pto table onto itself. This is needed because this is the combination of two Excel sheets that get lumped together while calling the data.
      - `taken_pto`: Calculates the amount of already taken paid leave days to later join it to the existing pto entitlement data.

    columns:
      - name: year
        description: The first day of the year that the entitlement is for.
