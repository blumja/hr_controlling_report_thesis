    description: |
      This model calculates absences and their durations based on the data from 'cleaned_absences'.The model is built using the following CTEs:

      - `named_absences`: This CTE calculates the total hours and mandays for named absences (urlaub, krank, kurzarbeit) using the 'cleaned_absences' data.
      - `other_absences`: This CTE calculates the total hours and mandays for other absences that aren't named explicitly by subtracting named absences from the total absences.
      - `unpivot`: This CTE unpivots the data and differentiates the absences by type 'Urlaub', 'Krank', 'Kurzarbeit', and 'Anderes'.

    columns:
      - name: date
        description: Date of the absence.
