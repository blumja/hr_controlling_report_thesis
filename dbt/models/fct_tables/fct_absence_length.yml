  - name: fct_absence_length
    description: |
      This model calculates absence length based on the data from 'cleaned_absences'.
      The model is built using the following CTEs:

      - `fill_weekend`: Fills the empty weekend days with 1 to make sure consecutive days aren't broken apart.
      - `ranked_entries`: Creates a ranking to base the groups in the next cte.
      - `date_groups`: Creates groups that belong together. Adds a column to differentiate between weekdays and weekends.
      - `interval_consecutive`: Creates columns for start and end as well as counting the consecutive days. Weekends are subtracted.
      - `correct_start_end`: Corrects the start and end date if they are on the weekend.
