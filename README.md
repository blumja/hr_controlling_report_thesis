# 💡Information

This repository contains the code for the practical part of my bachelor's thesis “Konzeption und Entwicklung eines Human Resource Dashboards zum Überblicken von Personalarbeiten”. This code is not available in an “executable” format and the files are limited to the relevant aspects of the illustration shown in the text section. It therefore serves purely as a reference work for the processing logic.
